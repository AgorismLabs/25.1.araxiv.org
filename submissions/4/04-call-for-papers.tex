\section*{Call for Papers: Volume 26.1}

The Amateur Research Association (ARA) invites submissions for its next issue, Volume 26.1, scheduled for publication in Spring 2026.

We welcome original research, whitepapers, and reviews from independent researchers, citizen scientists, and industry professionals across all disciplines. Our mission is to provide a professional platform for work that falls outside the traditional academic publishing ecosystem.

Submissions should be prepared in LaTeX using our official submission template and submitted via a pull request to our GitHub repository. For detailed instructions, please visit our website.

The deadline for consideration for Volume 26.1 is **December 15, 2025**.
