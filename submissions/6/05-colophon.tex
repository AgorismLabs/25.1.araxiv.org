\section*{Colophon}

This release of the Amateur Research Association Transactions was produced using a fully open-source, automated pipeline.

Manuscripts were written in LaTeX and typeset using the \texttt{IEEEtran.cls} class file. Submissions were managed as pull requests on GitHub, where a series of automated checks were performed using GitHub Actions.

The final release volume was assembled using the \texttt{towncrier} utility (update: decided not to implement that for now) and compiled to PDF. The individual articles and the collected volume are hosted permanently on GitHub Pages. The source code for our entire publishing process is openly available in our main repository.
