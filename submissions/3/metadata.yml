  The established paradigms of scholarly communication present significant barriers to entry for a growing global community of independent researchers and citizen scientists. This whitepaper introduces the Amateur Research Association (ARA), a novel framework designed to address this gap by creating a professionally managed, open-source, and low-cost publishing platform. We propose a four-tiered strategic roadmap that begins with a minimal viable product focused on core automation and scales to a sustainable institution that actively fosters the careers of its members. The ARAâ€™s methodology is rooted in a Git-native workflow that leverages GitHub Actions, LaTeX, and a curated release model to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and quality. Key innovations include the integration of essential scholarly infrastructure (e.g., Crossref DOIs, ORCID profiles), the creation of a fellowship program to provide direct support to researchers, and the implementation of a "Momentum Publishing System." This document details the project's founding team, market opportunity, go-to-market strategy, and competitive positioning, presenting a comprehensive blueprint for the project's implementation and long-term success.
